/**
 * OBSERVER PATTERN Interface
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Defines the contract for objects that need to be notified of game events.
 * Implements publish-subscribe pattern for loose coupling between game logic
 * and event consumers (WebSocket clients, logging, analytics, etc.).
 *
 * Pattern Benefits:
 * - Loose coupling between subject (game) and observers
 * - Multiple observers can react to same event
 * - Easy to add new observers without modifying game logic
 * - Open/Closed Principle compliance
 *
 * Use Cases in ONE Game:
 * - WebSocket notifications to clients
 * - Game event logging
 * - Analytics and statistics tracking
 * - Achievement/badge unlocking
 * - Real-time spectator updates
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * <pre>
 * GameObserver wsObserver = new WebSocketObserver(messagingTemplate);
 * GameObserver logObserver = new LoggingObserver();
 * gameSession.addObserver(wsObserver);
 * gameSession.addObserver(logObserver);
 * // Both observers will be notified of all game events
 * </pre>
